				<p>
					My first book is for purchase. 
				</p>
				<p>
					My passion is empowering women with the tools that help them move forward during grief, loss, pain, change, or challenges. So that they can live out their dreams and become the best version of who God created them to be. 

				</p>
				<p>
					You are Godâ€™s highest form of creation, made in his image. You are made to live your passion. I hope this book will encourage you to do just that.
					</p>
					<p>
					This is a book about bereavement. It is my journey through the loss of my husband in 2012. These are my thoughts as I walked through the grief process. I hope to write another book in the future of the years that transpired after that and my faith in Christ to inspire others. I want to be able to inspire others that there is hope and a new future after loss.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Thank you and may you remember it is not who you are that holds you back, it is who you think you are not.
				</p>
				<p>
					Blessings, <br />
					Sweet Strength
