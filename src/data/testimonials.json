I had met Linda Timmons over ten plus years ago and knew how dedicated she was to wellness and fitness, and thought she would be the perfect fit. I started training with Linda in the summer of that year and still see her twice a week today. Linda helps me stay focused and inspires me to reach for my goals. I thoroughly enjoy and look forward to her training me during the week. It helps keep me fit, while de-stressed as well. Linda always pushes and drives me to do my best. I believe Linda knows what her client‚Äôs individual needs are, knows how much to push them to get the results that we are looking for. I always leave feeling better than when I walked in. Always. It is nice to have someone beside you, to keep you on the right path and be your cheerleader. Always smiling and positive. I consider her not only my personal trainer, but a good friend as well. Thank you, Linda - for keeping me focused and on the path to great fitness and wellness!",

One of my goals was to start training and I am now. Life does not have to be hard. It is amazing what we can accomplish in life! I have changed in many ways and awake now every morning with an &#8220;I Can &amp; Will Do&#8221; attitude. I am at peace and am so thankful for Linda and Sweet Strength.",

And Linda patiently, lovingly and skillfully guided me in setting attainable goals, encouraging me and helping me to create boundaries, building me up, not tearing me down. When we started working out, it was awesome! She gave me a positive physical outlet for my excess energy to benefit me in all areas. It helped me focus, work towards my goals, and improved my self image. I loved it! It was challenging and fun. I felt energized and strong. And sure, I would gripe a bit sometimes - but she pushed me in a good way. Life changed dramatically for me that year. I had been flailing; with Linda‚Äôs help - I began to find me again. Sweet Strength is empowering, encouraging and uplifting . . . because that‚Äôs what Linda is. I highly recommend both!",

I would wake up every morning and ask Jesus, ‚ÄúPlease help me lose weight. Please help me go to You rather than food to meet my needs.‚Äù I did this for years. I was morbidly obese with nothing to stop me from getting bigger. It was scary. Then, I had happened to have breakfast with a dear friend - Linda Timmons, whom I hadn‚Äôt seen in a couple of years. She told me she had started a new business doing wellness coaching and told me a little bit about how it worked. My heart leapt, I dared to think that maybe this was Jesus answering my prayers. I began to meet with Linda totally by faith. She would ask me questions that made me think, really think. She constantly challenged me in my thinking . . . It took a little over three months and I had lost 22 pounds and gone down an unbelievable 45 points on cholesterol. I‚Äôm now exercising regularly, doing things I‚Äôve never done before, never thought I could. My husband has commented it is so impressive to him of the total change in my life.",

If you are willing to open your mind and accept challenges, she will teach you how to overcome and grow through them. The opportunities presented have changed the way I view myself, the world, and the people around me, and will forever have an impact on how I live my life.

Then I cam to Linda and we decided I could take control of my body. Working with Sweet Strength three times per week, for a few weeks I had a combination of Wellness training and personal training, then went to all personal training. It‚Äôs absolutely amazing how I have improved! Strong all over. My knee is so much better. I‚Äôm doing squats and all kinds of things like that! My whole body has changed. My eating habits have changed. My outlook on life is stronger and brighter. I‚Äôm determined to never stop taking care of myself again! Sweet Strength taught me so much about foods, my body and about myself mentally and emotionally!",
