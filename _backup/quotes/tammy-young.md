Thank you very much for everything you have done for me. You were very supportive and encouraging when I needed it most. Thank you for all of your guidance and for helping me become a better me! In working with you as my Wellness Coach, Personal Trainer and Life Coach, not only did I lose 10 lbs. and become more tone than Iâ€™ve ever been in my life (age 55), I also had several breakthroughs with my thought patterns. You worked with me until we got to the root of the problem! Sometimes it was uncomfortable, but well worth it! You are a Personal Trainer, Wellness Coach and Life Coach who motivates, cares about people and sets a good example! I would highly recommend you because you are competent, professional, and very goal oriented for your clients. You are the best in your field!
