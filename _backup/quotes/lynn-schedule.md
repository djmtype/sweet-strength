I love my Trainer/Wellness coach. I’m learning so much about exercise and eating! I feel this is one of God’s lessons he put in front of me after going through sickness. Linda is there for all people – sick and not sick. You can be thin and still be unhealthy, you can be heavy and need to have someone from the outside look in to help. And – let’s not call it dieting – let’s call it a way of life and do it for life. She is a very Godly woman, and YES she will pray for you and with you.
