Meeting Linda Timmons was a life changing experience. After 9 months I felt like a different person . . . eating healthier, working out regularly and feeling better now at 59 than ever. Linda has a very unique ability and teaching style. She starts with rebuilding your foundation and gives you a desire to succeed. . . . as great as I feel now, I can not imagine how I will feel a year from now. Thank you, Linda. You are very gifted in what you do, this has been one of the most rewarding experiences ever.
