I had no direction in life for a long time. Then – I started coaching sessions with Linda. She helped me with self esteem, toxic thoughts, problem solving, and controlling my emotions and fears, thinking outside of the box…just to name a few. In just a short time, I learned that I chose where I am in life today with the ability to change where I am to be where I want to be by setting goals. One of my goals was to start training and I am now. Life does not have to be hard. It is amazing what we can accomplish in life! I have changed in many ways and awake now every morning with an “I Can & Will Do” attitude. I am at peace and am so thankful for Linda and Sweet Strength.
