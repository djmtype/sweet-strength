I met Linda during a time where I was really struggling to get back on track to find my way to a healthier, happy self after going through a catastrophic health event with my husband for over a year. I was tired and knew it was time to focus on my health. I took a six week challenge and realized the then owner of that gym put me in way over my abilities. But then I met Linda, she was the instructor at my second class. I could feel energy and positive vibes coming into the room because of her presence. She drew me in and I knew she was going to be my coach.

I approached her after the group class and asked if we could start working out together, and also – did she think she could find someone else for me to share her sessions with. Within a week, I had a workout partner who was my age and struggling with weight as I was. The three of us instantly formed a friendship and bond. But, Linda is just more than a workout coach. She helps you look deep inside your soul, lifts you spiritually, and continues to feed and help you to find your inner strength. Through her I have learned to think more positively, journal my food and try to spread joy to those around me. Through this journey with her I have found a friend, mentor and coach.

If you want someone that will help you find your strength and positivity ~ call Linda. She is a Godsend for me, I know that God brought her into my life for a reason. And, if you are looking for a male coach, her husband Breeze is working with my husband who is trying to regain his strength! Breeze has been a positive influence for my husband as well, his spirit is now uplifted, and he is seeing the world in a different way, coming out of his shell again and living. I attribute a lot of this to the way Breeze cares about his success. What a team! Sweet Strength….let them help you find yours.
