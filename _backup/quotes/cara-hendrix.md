What an awesome training/coaching experience! Linda, you are such an inspiration. I don’t think I have met a more consistently positive person! Always encouraging, always complimenting, always finding good things to focus on. Your outlook on life is so contagious and such a joy to be around! You made me re-look at both my physical body, and what goes on inside as well, ie. what I put in my body (sugar!). You encouraged me to push myself a little harder and to set small goals. You’ve inspired me to really take care of my “whole” body, inside and out! Getting in touch with you has been a blessing for me! “Sweet Strength” empowered me like never before.
