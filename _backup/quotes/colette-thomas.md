When I began my coaching and training sessions with Linda I was a mess. Really – a big, giant, unfocused, insecure mess. And Linda patiently, lovingly and skillfully guided me in setting attainable goals, encouraging me and helping me to create boundaries, building me up, not tearing me down. When we started working out, it was awesome! She gave me a positive physical outlet for my excess energy to benefit me in all areas. It helped me focus, work towards my goals, and improved my self image. I loved it! It was challenging and fun. I felt energized and strong. And sure, I would gripe a bit sometimes – but she pushed me in a good way. Life changed dramatically for me that year. I had been flailing; with Linda’s help – I began to find me again. Sweet Strength is empowering, encouraging and uplifting . . . because that’s what Linda is. I highly recommend both!
