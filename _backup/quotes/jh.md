I was stuck and lived in daily torment. I knew what the problem was – it was me. I didn’t know what to do about it except to cry out to Jesus for help. I would wake up every morning and ask Jesus, “Please help me lose weight. Please help me go to You rather than food to meet my needs.” I did this for years. I was morbidly obese with nothing to stop me from getting bigger. It was scary. Then, I had happened to have breakfast with a dear friend – Linda Timmons, whom I hadn’t seen in a couple of years. She told me she had started a new business doing wellness coaching and told me a little bit about how it worked. My heart leapt, I dared to think that maybe this was Jesus answering my prayers. I began to meet with Linda totally by faith. She would ask me questions that made me think, really think. She constantly challenged me in my thinking . . . It took a little over three months and I had lost 22 pounds and gone down an unbelievable 45 points on cholesterol. I’m now exercising regularly, doing things I’ve never done before, never thought I could. My husband has commented it is so impressive to him of the total change in my life.
