Linda has completely changed my life and the way I view myself. She is encouraging. I never realized how negative I was concerning myself until I started training and coaching with Sweet Strength. But, I have changed my perception of myself and look forward to my sessions, because she truly cares about her clients and I cannot believe how fast the time goes by. I wish every woman could train with her. My family thinks it is one of the best things I have ever done. Thank you Linda for walking beside me and for helping me overcome many challenges. You are absolutely wonderful.
