Been in and out of gyms my whole adult life; sometimes there would be months in between visits – so I decided to inquire about having a personal trainer to keep me motivated. I had met Linda Timmons over ten plus years ago and knew how dedicated she was to wellness and fitness, and thought she would be the perfect fit. I started training with Linda in the summer of that year and still see her twice a week today. Linda helps me stay focused and inspires me to reach for my goals. I thoroughly enjoy and look forward to her training me during the week. It helps keep me fit, while de-stressed as well. Linda always pushes and drives me to do my best. I believe Linda knows what her client’s individual needs are, knows how much to push them to get the results that we are looking for. I always leave feeling better than when I walked in. Always. It is nice to have someone beside you, to keep you on the right path and be your cheerleader. Always smiling and positive. I consider her not only my personal trainer, but a good friend as well. Thank you, Linda – for keeping me focused and on the path to great fitness and wellness!
