Since we (61 year-old me and my 65-year-old husband) started training with Linda and Breeze, we are stronger, more toned, more flexible and feeling healthier than ever! Strongly recommend this dynamic duo, whether you are interested in gaining muscle, endurance, better nutrition habits or need a life change. They’ll customize sessions, energize you (and you’ll have an awesome time while pursuing your fitness goals). Good people with a great track record of success.
