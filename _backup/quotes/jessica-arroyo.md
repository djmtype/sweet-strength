There is so much to say about Linda Timmons and Sweet Strength. I have been training with Linda for a year, and have also done personal coaching with her. She is now a great friend and mentor to me, it is so exciting to see how gifted she is in areas of encouraging people to be more healthy. I was battling depression, but Sweet Strength was such a blessing to me. Some of best days during this trying time were after training with Linda. She helped me stay on track, coached me how to change my thinking and gave me great nutritional advice. She is the kind of person who is truly compassionate and cares for her clients. Sweet Strength truly will help women at any age reach their fitness and personal goals.
