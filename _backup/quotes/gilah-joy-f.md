I recommend this place for so many reasons. Not only is it a place to work out, but it’s a haven. I hadn’t exercised in a long time due to medical conditions, and was nervous about starting back. I went to some other places doing research, before making my decision on where I wanted to go, and they didn’t seem to have much knowledge about exercise in relation to medical conditions and weren’t very personalized (unlike \*Sweet Strength\*). Because they’re personal/one-on-one sessions, there is no judgement, no need to feel self conscious. Linda is also a Life Coach, among many other helpful and wonderful things, so not only do I get exercise to keep my body in check, but I get someone to talk to, laugh with, and get advice from. I appreciate her energy and passion for supporting other women. Go check it out, you won’t regret it. Thanks Sweet Strength Fitness Studio and Linda Chandler Timmons 💪🏋️‍♀️🧘‍♀️
