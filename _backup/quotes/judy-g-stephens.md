Do I recommend Sweet Strength Studio? Absolutely! I’m 65 and had not exercised on a regular basis in quite awhile. I luckily found Linda and she now has me on a good path back to becoming fit. If you want someone who will motivate you, listen to you, and give you advice in a non-judgemental way, then come see Linda Timmons. She is always learning and continuing to educate herself in fitness and nutrition. It’s great to be able to walk in to the studio, be warmly greeted and know that a caring person will be with you every step of the way encouraging you to be your very best!
