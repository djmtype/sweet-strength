Linda Timmons could not have shown up into my life at a better time, and I could not have asked for a better life coach . . . in finding my true purpose in life, I was unsure of how to pursue my goals, where to start, what my big dream even really was ~ with Linda’s guidance, my faith strengthened, goals became clear, and I landed a dream job working specifically within my passion. If you are willing to open your mind and accept challenges, she will teach you how to overcome and grow through them. The opportunities presented have changed the way I view myself, the world, and the people around me, and will forever have an impact on how I live my life. I can’t wait to see what my future has in store. Thank you, Linda for an amazing journey.
