As a 37 year old mother of two, I had a set of goals that I hadn’t achieved because of life’s busyness and challenges. I contacted Linda at Sweet Strength, and through our sessions, my goals are becoming more attainable as they were broken down into manageable steps to achieve them and implement them into a new lifestyle. Linda helps her clients become equipped with both the mental and physical tools to achieve results – without being judgmental or critical. Thank you, Linda. You showed me it’s never too late to live a healthy and joyful life!
