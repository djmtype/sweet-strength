Who knew that when I met and started my coaching/workouts with Linda at Sweet Strength that it would be a life-changing experience? She has the ability to inspire, motivate, and break through old patterns by re-framing any thoughts and language that keep you from being successful in reaching your goals. I love the focus on the total well-being, while still ensuring that your unique physical needs are taken into account! I LOVE this program more than any other I have ever tried. Thank you, Linda!
