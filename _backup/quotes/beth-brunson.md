I was pretty much at the end of my rope with no idea where to turn. My body had gone terribly downhill over the previous two years, gaining weight while losing muscle power and tone. Plus, I was in pain all the time and had to cut back on work time as I couldn’t stand for eight hours required. Some days I couldn’t even walk because of whatever was wrong with my knee . . . Then I cam to Linda and we decided I could take control of my body. Working with Sweet Strength three times per week, for a few weeks I had a combination of Wellness training and personal training, then went to all personal training. It’s absolutely amazing how I have improved! Strong all over. My knee is so much better. I’m doing squats and all kinds of things like that! My whole body has changed. My eating habits have changed. My outlook on life is stronger and brighter. I’m determined to never stop taking care of myself again! Sweet Strength taught me so much about foods, my body and about myself mentally and emotionally!
