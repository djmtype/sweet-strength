I ran across Breeze at Crunch Fitness and began talking about weightlifting, which led to me bringing up the fact that my lower back would become fatigued while doing squats.. He invited me to his gym, Sweet Strength, to watch me and the rest is history.. Breeze is very knowledgeable and has many many many years of powerlifting and strength coaching under his belt. He has helped me immensely and I would highly recommend reaching out to him for any and all training goals. 5+++ stars!
