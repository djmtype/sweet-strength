My ‘Sweet Strength Story’. I found Linda that December because life wanted it that way! To make me a better me! From the first time I sat down in Linda’s office, I knew she was the right person to help me accomplish what I had set out to do. She was confident, passionate about her work and compassionate on the things women go through concerning their bodies and emotions! The goal was to be healthy: it meant LEARNING how to eat right, taking care of my body as it deserved to be treated . . . I lost 10 lbs. and have lost several inches in my arms, legs, waist and neck! Those numbers don’t do this journey justice! I have been eating the healthiest that I have ever ate my entire life. I have accomplished things that I never thought I would do again. I have now run in 3-5k’s and 1-Mudd Run! . . . it has been no easy journey – WE have managed as team! It’s amazing what can be done when you have the support of someone who simply just understands and is willing to work as hard as you do . . .
